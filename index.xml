      <description>In the past years I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered some FLAC files that for some reason refused to play on my Android devices. When I did try to play them, I was greeted by the following message:
 Sorry, the player does not support this type of audio file.  Until recently I&amp;rsquo;ve accepted this to be a bug in Android / my music player app (PlayerPro which is awesome!). But I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to try and uncover what made those FLAC files &amp;ldquo;unsupported&amp;rdquo;, which turned out to be easier than I initially thought.</description>

      <description>For quite some time now I&amp;rsquo;ve been using i3 as my (tiling) window manager of choice. When I just started using it, I&amp;rsquo;ve coupled it with rxvt-unicode (aka urxvt) only because I noticed many other users of i3 were using it. In a certain point of time after using urxvt, I started to look for an alternative terminal that will be easier to configure and will support copy &amp;amp; paste to and from the clipboard out-of-the-box.</description>

      <description>For a very long time I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Memtest86+ (Memtest86 fork) to test RAM modules.
Whether I was overcloking my own PC, debugging blue screens or instabilities, this was my go-to tool.
The original Memtest86 was developed by a man named Chris Brady, but was later purchased by PassMark Software, and now being actively developed by them. Memtest86+ on the other hand seems to be abandoned by now, with the latest release date being September 27, 2013.</description>

      <description>The Blog After playing with some static-site-generators and having a long lasting urge for writing my own blog, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally decided to make it happen. This blog is mainly about me sharing my experiences and 2Â¢ on my voyage in the sea of awesome tech.</description>
